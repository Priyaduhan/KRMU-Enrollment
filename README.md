Description -

It is a web-based application that manages the interaction process during college admission. After a candidate passes the MCQ test , the qualified students are scheduled for interviews with two teachers. Based on their feedback, the system sends a final selection or rejection email. This project helps make the admission process smooth, fast, and organized.
